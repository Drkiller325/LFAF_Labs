## Theory
a lexer is a component of the compiler that breaks down each line of code into it's different keyword or (tokens) that define and operate in a given programming language after which they're passed to the parser
that constructs an abstract parsing tree(AST) which will then be used to compile the program.


## Objectives:

* Understand what lexical analysis [1] is.
* Get familiar with the inner workings of a lexer/scanner/tokenizer.
* Implement a sample lexer and show how it works.


## Implementation description

first we need to identifiy the keywords which the lexer will recognize as keywords


* If needed, screenshots.
